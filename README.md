# Quiz Game in Python

This is a simple Python quiz game that tests your knowledge by asking a series of questions. You'll be presented with multiple-choice options for each question, and your task is to select the correct answer. The game keeps track of your score and provides feedback on your performance.

## Features

- Randomly selects questions from a predefined set.
- Validates user input to ensure it's within the correct range (1, 2, 3, or 4).
- Provides a final score at the end of the quiz.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the game.

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to answer the questions.

5. At the end of the quiz, your score will be displayed.

## Customization

You can customize the quiz by adding more questions to the `questions` list in the `main.py` file. Each question should be represented as a dictionary with the question text, choices, and the correct answer.
